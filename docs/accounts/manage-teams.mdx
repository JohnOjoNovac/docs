## Overview

Roles in the Novac Dashboard help you define and manage the level of access each team member has to your business account.  
By creating custom roles, you can assign specific permissions based on responsibilities ensuring that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions such as initiating payouts, managing transactions, or viewing reports.  

The Administrator role is automatically created for the business account owner and has full permissions by default.  
If you want to delegate specific responsibilities without granting full access, you can create a new role and assign only the permissions required for that team member’s tasks.

## Create a new Role
