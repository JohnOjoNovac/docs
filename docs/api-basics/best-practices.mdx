## Authentication

- Keep secret Keys confidential, expose them in frontend code or public repositories could pose serious threat as an hawker can gain auathourize access to your API resources.  
- Ensure that you store secret keys in an environment variables.  
- Rotate keys periodically and revoke compromised keys immediately.  
- Use public keys only for client-side operations like checkout initialization.

## Use Test Mode First

- Always start integration in test mode to avoid real charges.  
- Use the provided test cards, PINs, and OTPs to simulate transactions.  
- Verify edge cases: failed payments, declined transactions, refunds, and OTP validation.

## Receiving Payments

- Ensure that you verify all transaction before giving value to your customers.
- We advice that you listen to payment events via webhook. As its a reliable means of handling transaction updates.

## Handling Sensitive Information

- Ensure that you encrypt all sensitive data when processing card information.
- Follow our [direct card charge API](api-reference/collections/encrypt-data) for encrypting customers data. 
- Ensure that you reduce the storage of sensitive data if possible.

## Handle Errors Gracefully

- Implement **retry logic** for transient network or server errors.  
- Always check the status, `responseCode`, and `responseMessage` in API responses.  
- Surface clear error messages to users e.g., “Invalid card details”, instead of raw API errors.  
- Ensure that you store all logs properly and follow [global log retention standard](https://docs.exabeam.com/en/exa-search/all/search-guide/search-overview/log-retention/global-log-retention.html)
