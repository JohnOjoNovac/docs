## Overview

Novac provides test credentials that allow you to simulate different payment scenarios while integrating with the gateway.  
These credentials help you test successful payments, failed transactions, and OTP validation before switching to the live environment.  

## Successful Transaction Test Card

Use this card to simulate successful transactions. Make sure you set a valid future date for the expiryMonth and expiryYear.

```json
{
  "cardNumber": "5555555555554444",
  "expiryMonth": "Any future month (e.g., 12)",
  "expiryYear": "Any future year (e.g., 2028)",
  "cvv": "Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)",
  "cardPin": "Any 4 digits (e.g., 1234)"
}
```

When to Use: This test card simulates a typical debit/credit card that will result in a “successful” payment response.
Expected Gateway Response: Payment approved or success.


## Failed Transaction Test Card

Use this card to simulate failed transactions. Again, ensure you have a valid future date for the expiry.

```json
{
  "cardNumber": "1234567898765432",
  "expiryMonth": "Any future month (e.g., 12)",
  "expiryYear": "Any future year (e.g., 2028)",
  "cvv": "Any 3 digits (e.g., 456)",
  "cardPin": "Any 4 digits (e.g., 5678)"
}
```

When to Use: This test card forces a transaction failure (e.g., insufficient funds, declined transaction).
Expected Gateway Response: Payment declined or failure.

## OTP Validation

Use this OTP to simulate additional verification (3-D Secure or other form of 2FA).

```json
{
  "otp": "Any 6 digits (e.g., 123456)"
}
```

When to Use: After initiating a payment with a card and additional verification is requested.
Expected Gateway Response: OTP verified or OTP error if incorrect.
