description: Learn how to complete payments securely via Novac’s hosted prebuilt checkout.
---

## Overview

Novac provides a prebuilt hosted checkout that allows your customers to complete payments securely and seamlessly.  
We recommend this method because it abstracts away all the complexities of handling payment flows, allowing you to focus solely on initiating and tracking transactions.

Once you successfully create a checkout payment using the API, the response will contain a `paymentRedirectUrl`.  

You can simply redirect your customer to this URL to complete the payment via the prebuilt checkout interface.

<Note>
  The prebuilt checkout automatically supports all available payment options — such as Cards, Pay with Bank Transfer and USSD. without requiring you to build additional payment logic.

## Prerequisite

<Accordion title="See details">
  Before completing a payment via the prebuilt checkout, ensure that you have:
  - Created a checkout payment with a [transaction reference](/docs/accept-payment/use-cases/create-checkout-with-transaction-reference) or [payment link reference](/docs/accept-payment/use-cases/accept-payment-with-payment-links#create-a-checkout-payment-with-payment-link-reference) — this provides the `paymentRedirectUrl` needed for redirection.
  - Set up your `redirectUrl` either on the dashboard or in the API request to ensure users are properly redirected after payment completion.

## Complete a Payment

After creating a checkout payment, you’ll receive a response that includes a `paymentRedirectUrl` field:

```json expandable created checkout payment response data
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Transaction Initialized successfully",
    "data": {
        "transactionReference": "1oWbJQQHLyQqqf1SwxjSpudeA01nm",
        "amount": 1000,
        "statusCode": "01",
        "statusMessage": "Transaction initiated successfully",
        "publicKey": "nc_testpk_a0kuivx6lst100haeqo2eyoxkcqdmmeyyr",
        "paymentRedirectUrl": "https://www.app.novacpayment.com/pay/payments?reference=1oWbJQQHLyQqqf1SwxjSpudeA01nm",
        "collectionPaymentOptions": "CARD,PWBT,USSD,NQR"
    }
}
```

To complete the payment, simply redirect your customer to the `paymentRedirectUrl`.
This URL opens Novac’s prebuilt checkout, where customers can choose a preferred payment methods.

<Info> 
  You can open the `paymentRedirectUrl` in a new tab. The prebuilt checkout handles all authentication, processing automatically.
