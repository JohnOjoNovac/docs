## Overview

Payment Links extend the functionality of Checkouts, offering a powerful and flexible way to receive payments from your customers. They support multiple payment methods and can be accessed from anywhere, on any device, ensuring a seamless payment experience for your customers.
Merchants can use Novac Payment Links for a variety of purposes, including online sales on social media, service subscriptions, loan repayments, and even donations or fundraising campaigns. This is due to the reusability nature.

   You can create payment link via API or on Novac dashboard. When you create from your dashboard they are mostly reusable, this means that you can receive inflows from a single created payment link by sending to multiple customers. However if you intend to create a payment link for just one time purpose, you can create a checkout payment with payment link reference via API.

## Create a checkout payment with payment link reference

Creating a checkout payment with payment link reference via API allows you to further customize the experience for your customer. Every single payment link created on the dashboard comes with a unique "Payment Link Reference" also known as the `paymentURL`. You can also see this as initiating a transaction via payment link reference and it can be used for one time payment.

You can find this reference by clicking to view the details of any payment link on your dashboard.  

Click on a single payment link from the list to view its details:

<Frame description="Details of a payment link">
  <img 
    src="/images/payment-url.png" 
    alt="View payment link reference on Novac Dashboard"
  />
</Frame>

<Warning>
  The `paymentURL` you use should correspond to a link that accepts **varying amounts**.  
  This enables you to specify any amount dynamically via the API.  
  However, if an amount was set when creating the link, that **exact amount** must be provided in the request object.
</Warning>

```bash expandable Request
curl --request POST \
  --url https://api.novacpayment.com/api/v1/paymentlink/initiate \
  --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "paymentLinkReference": "oeXQckL",

    "checkoutCustomizationData": {

      "paymentDescription": "",
