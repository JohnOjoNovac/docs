title: Refund a Transaction
description: Learn how to use the Refund API to process full or partial refunds seamlessly.
---

## Overview

The refund API allows you to reverse transactions in part or in full, providing flexibility and control when handling customer requests, errors, or operational reversals.

---

## How It Works

When a transaction is successfully completed, you can initiate a refund by making a request to the refund API.  

To process the refund efficiently, follow these steps:

1. Authenticate Your Request : Include your Secret Key in the `Authorization` header to securely authenticate the refund request.

2. Provide the Order Reference : use the unique `reference` associated with the transaction you want to refund.

3. Add Optional Details  You may include additional context for the refund using either.

4. Process a Full or Partial Refund
   - Full Refund: Refunds the entire transaction amount.
   - Partial Refund: Refunds a portion of the total amount â€” useful when customers return only part of an order or when a service is partially fulfilled.

## Partial Refunds Explained

A partial refund allows you to return only a portion of the original payment instead of the full amount.  
This is ideal for scenarios like:

- A customer cancels one item in a multi-item order.  
- A service was only partially delivered.  
- You want to retain a processing or cancellation fee.
