## Overview

Novac allows you to securely save a customer’s card for future transactions, enabling a smooth and reliable experience for recurring or repeat payments.  

This feature is especially useful for businesses offering subscriptions, memberships, or installment-based billing, as it eliminates the need for customers to re-enter their card details each time.  

When a customer first completes a payment, Novac returns a **tokenized card reference** representing the saved card.

You can then use this token to initiate future charges automatically without requiring additional card input from the customer.

<Warning>  
  Ensure that the actual card details are never stored on your servers — only secure, tokenized references.
</Warning>

## How to get a card token reference

When a payment is completed and you [verify the transaction](api-reference/checkout/verify-transaction) with it reference, we return a core transaction details containing the customers card details plus other information.
