## Overview

Novac allows you to securely save a customer’s card for future transactions, enabling a smooth and reliable experience for recurring or repeat payments.  

This feature is especially useful for businesses offering subscriptions, memberships, or installment-based billing, as it eliminates the need for customers to re-enter their card details each time.  

When a customer first completes a payment, Novac returns a **tokenized card reference** representing the saved card.

You can then use this token to initiate future charges automatically without requiring additional card input from the customer.

<Warning>  
  Ensure that the actual card details are never stored on your servers — only secure, tokenized references.
</Warning>

## How customer card tokenization works

When you [verify a transaction](/api-reference/checkout/verify-transaction) using its reference, Novac returns a transaction details that includes the customer’s card information.  

Within this customer’s card object, you’ll find a `token` field. This token serves as a secure representation of the customer’s card, allowing you to charge the card for future payments.

```json expandable title="Sample Transaction Verification Response 
{
    "status": true,
    "message": "Transaction details retrieved successfully",
    "data": {
        // transaction information
        "card": {
            "first6Digits": "",
            "last4Digits": "",
            "issuer": "",
            "country": "",
            "type": "",
            "token": ""
        },
        "customer": {
            // customer information
        },
        "transferDetail": {
            // transfer information if payment is transfer
        }
    }
}
```
In the example above, the `token` field represents the customer’s securely stored card reference.
This token is what you’ll use to charge the customer again in the future — without requesting their card details.

## Charge a customer's saved card

To charge a customer’s saved card, make a [POST request](api-reference/collections/tokenized-card-charge) to the `/api/v1/tokenized-card-charge endpoint`.
This request uses the previously returned token to process the payment securely.

```json expandable Request 
    curl --request POST \
        --url https://api.novacpayment.com/api/v1/tokenized-card-charge \
        --header 'Authorization: <api-key>' \
        --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        --data '{
            "token": "<string>",
            "currency": "<string>",
            "amount": 123,
            "email": "<string>",
            "firstName": "<string>",
            "lastName": "<string>",
            "reference": "<string>"
       }'
```
