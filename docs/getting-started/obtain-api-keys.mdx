## Overview 

To ensure seamless communication between your application and Novac Payment, you'll need your API keys. Novac uses these keys to authenticate every request from your application.  

Each account is provided with two sets of API keys **public** and **secret** for both **Test** and **Live** environment.  

### Public keys 

Public keys are safe to use on the client-side. They are typically used for initiating transactions such as **checkout, payment links, and in-app collections**. Public keys cannot modify your account or access sensitive data.  

### Secret keys 

Secret keys are highly sensitive and must be kept confidential. They are used for secure operations such as **payouts, refunds, and accessing financial data**. All server-side API calls should be authenticated with your secret key.  

<Warning>
  Never expose your secret keys in client-side code. If you suspect that your secret key has been compromised, you can quickly regenerate it on your Novac dashboard. This renders the old one useless.
</Warning>

## Obtaining your API Keys

You can easily access your API keys from the Novac dashboard.
