## Overview  

Before you can access Novac Payment APIs or start accepting payments, youâ€™ll need a **merchant account**.  
This account serves as your business profile on Novac and will be used to manage payments, payouts, refunds, and compliance requirements.  

## Steps to Create a Merchant Account

<Steps>
  <Step title="Step 1 - Create your account (Sign up)">
    Go to the [**Sign Up**](https://www.app.novacpayment.com/register) page and complete the registration form. Provide a valid email address, weâ€™ll use this to verify your account, choose a strong password, and fill any required business details.

    **Tips**
    - Use a strong password (8+ characters recommended).  
    - If you plan to accept payments from customers, use your business email for clarity in communications.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 2 - Verify your email">
    After sign up, check your inbox for a verification message from **hello@novacpayment.com** and click the verification link to activate your account.

    **If you don't see the email**
    - Check Spam/Promotions folders.  
    - Use the **Resend verification** option on the signup page.  
    - If the link expires, request a fresh verification email.

    Once verified you will either receive a login link or be redirected to the Novac dashboard.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 3 - Finalize your account & Complete your KYC">
    After logging in, complete your account profile so the dashboard can show the right tools and configuration options.

    **Common fields to fill**
    - Business/legal name and address.  
    - Business phone number and website.  
    - Billing / contact email.  
    - Default currency and expected monthly transaction volume.  
    - Bank account for receiving payouts (if you plan to use payouts).

    **Why this matters**
    - Accurate details speed up KYC and payout setup.  
    - The dashboard uses this information to pre-fill forms and generate correct receipts and statements.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 4 - Complete KYC (Know Your Customer)">
    To access live payment features (payouts, larger volumes, live API keys) youâ€™ll need to submit KYC information.

    **Typical documents you may be asked for**
    - Business registration/incorporation document (e.g., certificate of incorporation).  
    - Government-issued ID (passport, national ID, or driverâ€™s license) for beneficial owners and signatories.  
    - Proof of address (utility bill or bank statement dated within last 3 months).  
    - Bank statement or voided cheque for the account that will receive payouts.  
    - A short statement of business activity or website link (helps verification).

    **Process**
    - Upload documents via the Dashboard â†’ Settings â†’ KYC (or the onboarding flow).  
    - Review times vary â€” youâ€™ll be notified by email when the review completes.  
    - While KYC is pending, you can still use **Test mode** to integrate and validate your code.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Step 5 - Retrieve your API keys">
    Once your account is set up and KYC is completed, proceed to get your API keys; see [obtain API keys](docs/getting-started/obtain-api-keys)> to get started.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Next steps

**Before going live**

- Complete KYC and confirm live keys are visible.  
- Add your production secret key to a secure secrets manager.  
- Test full payment flows in Test mode (hosted checkout, direct charge, tokenization, refunds, webhooks).  
- Configure webhooks and verify signature verification locally.

After completing these steps youâ€™ll have created your Novac account, verified identity, and retrieved the API keys needed to integrate payments.
